# How to contribute

We're really glad you're interesting in contributing, or maybe you clicked the wrong file. Either way, we're glad you're here!

## Contributing

We're always open to contributions! If you feel that there's something you can add, or you want to make a feature request, please do!

Even if it might be a bit out of scope of the project, feel free to make an Issue or create a Pull Request and we can discuss it; we're all pretty nice people.

You don't have to contribute code if you don't want to - we love pull requests for documentation as well.

## Submitting changes

When creating a Pull Request, have a clear list of what you've done, follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine, we're not too fancy about that sort of stuff.

If you're interested in further information about submitting changes, take a look at our Issue and Pull Request templates. You can find these in the /sightsdev/.github repository, or by opening a new Pull Request or Issue.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. It's mostly common sense.

- Python follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines in most cases
- JavaScript follows whatever makes the most sense
- HTML classes are styled like `a-fancy-class` and IDs are `the_best_element`
- Documentation in Markdown (`.md`) format follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

If this is too unofficial or laid-back for you, don't worry: expanded style-guides will be added in the future.

## Code of conduct

Here at Sights, we like to promote the ideals of a safe and healthy open source community. You can read our code of conduct [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Thanks,
The Sights Core Development Team
